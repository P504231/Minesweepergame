# MinesweeperGame

A basic minesweeper game built using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

You have a 9*9 grid which makes a total of 81 boxes.
Out of these 81 boxes 10 boxes contain bomb and other boxes are normal.
If a normal box is clicked, the user is awarded a point and if a user clicks on a box containing a bomb, the game gets over (GAME OVER!) and we have an option to the user to start a fresh game.

## Time for Celebration 
If the user has scored 72 points it means he has clicked all the safe cells. Then "CONGRATULATIONS! You have won the game"

Users first! üôè

When users right click on a cell they see something like this

This way users can remember that they concluded there's a bomb in that cell and should not click it. If a user left-clicks on this flagged cell, normal flow should continue.
